          <p>I'm a recent graduate from the Custom-Designed Major at Drexel University. The Custom-Designed major allows select students to create their own, interdisciplinary major at the university. My major, Design Studies, focused on Graphic Design, Printmaking, and Art History and Theory. My experience with multiple subjects gives me a well-rounded view of art and design that is evident in my work.</p>

          <p>Inspiration for my work comes from contemporary art and design, as well as exploring new ways to create things. As a huge lover of art museums and galleries, I'm influenced by museums I've visited as a child in Pittsburgh, PA. When I'm not exploring artwork, I love making anything from laser cut jewelry to 3D printing my own typography.</p>

          <p>In 2013-2014, I completed a six-month internship at the University City Science Center in Philadelphia, PA. During my internship, I worked with FirstHand as an Arts Program intern.  In 2015, I completed a three-month Graphic Design internship at Philadelphia branding agency At Media, where I worked with clients such as HipCityVeg, Bar Bombon, and The Delaware River Waterfront Corporation. I am currently am a designer at Digitas Health, a creative health care agency in Philadelphia, PA, and am a freelance Graphic Designer.</p>
