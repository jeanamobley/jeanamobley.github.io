          <h1 class="about1">Hi, I'm Jeana. Nice to meet you.</h1>
          <p class="aboutparagraph">I am currently a graphic designer at Digitas Health, a pharmaceutical advertising agency in Philadelphia, PA. In 2015, I completed a three-month Graphic Design internship at Philadelphia branding agency At Media, where I worked with clients such as HipCityVeg, Bar Bombon, and The Delaware River Waterfront Corporation. In 2013-2014, I completed a six-month internship at the University City Science Center, where I was an in-house designer for the non-profit organization FirstHand.


          <p class="aboutparagraph">In 2015, I received a B.S from Drexel University, where I studied in the Custom-Designed Major. The Custom-Designed Major allows select students to create their own, interdisciplinary major through combining multiple subjects. My major, Design Studies, focused on Graphic Design, Printmaking, and Art History and Theory. My experience with multiple subjects gives me a well-rounded view of art and design that is evident in my work.</p>

          <p class="aboutparagraph">Inspiration for my work comes from contemporary art and design, as well as exploring new ways to create things. As a huge lover of art museums and galleries, I'm influenced by art I've seen as a child in Pittsburgh, PA. When I'm not finding new inspiration, I love making anything from laser cut jewelry to screenprints of my family, and finding new places to eat and drink in my neighborhood.</p>
